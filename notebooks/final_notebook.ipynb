    "One significant challenge in this project was the mismatch in the date ranges between the primary dataset and the ABS dataset. The primary dataset spanned from April 2021 to October 2022, while the ABS dataset ended in August 2021 which is the most current data available. This discrepancy resulted in incomplete data coverage for the earlier months of the primary dataset (April to July 2021), where no corresponding ABS data was available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the primary dataset included certain postcodes that are either unused or associated with postboxes, which were not present in the ABS dataset. This mismatch led to missing values during the merging process, potentially affecting the accuracy of eographical or postcode-based analysis."

    "To predict consumer fraud, transaction data was merged with fraud probability information. First, the transaction and fraud data are combined, creating two classification datasets. In merged_fraud_15, transactions with a fraud probability of 15% or less are classified as non-fraud (0), while in merged_fraud_20, the threshold is set to 20% or less. Logistic regression models are trained on both datasets to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent. Separately, the original merged_fraud dataset, which contains actual fraud probabilities, is used for linear regression to predict fraud probability directly. These models can be used to predict consumer fraud for future consumer data."

    "To identify merchants with the highest Compound Weekly Growth Rate (CWGR), the weekly revenue was analysed. After loading and aggregating transaction data by merchant and week, Prophet models were trained for each merchant to forecast future revenue and compute CWGR. Merchants were ranked based on their CWGR, and the top 10 were selected for further analysis. The revenue of these top merchants was scaled using MinMax scaling, and smooth curves were generated to visualise the trends in their monthly revenue over time. This analysis helped identify merchants with the fastest revenue growth, which could signal increased profitability and potential for the BNPL firm. However, it is important to assess whether the growth is sustainable or driven by temporary factors such as seasonal sales (e.g., during Christmas)."
